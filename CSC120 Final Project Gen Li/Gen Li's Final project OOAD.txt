Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Document Fleet Management System
Created by: Gen Li

1.1 Analysis Phase:
This section identifies the domain entities, actors, function points, and typical usage scenarios for the Fleet Management System.

1.2 Domain Analysis:
Entities identified in the problem domain:
- Boat: Represents each individual boat with attributes such as type, name, year, make/model, length, purchase price, and expenses.
- FleetManagement: The system controller managing a collection of boats.
- BoatType (enum): Represents categories of boats (SAILING, POWER).

1.3 Actors:
Human Actor:
- User (Club Staff / Commodore): Interacts with the system to add boats, remove boats, view fleet, and record expenses.

Non-human Actors:
- File System: Used for reading CSV files and saving/loading serialized database.

1.4 Function Points
Functions performed by the User:
- Add a new boat via CSV input
- Remove an existing boat by name
- Process a spending request
- Print full fleet report
- Exit system

Functions performed by Non-actors:
- Loading fleet from CSV file
- Loading fleet from serialized database
- Saving fleet to database on exit

1.5 Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Adding a Boat
1.) User selects 'Add'.
2.) System prompts for CSV boat data.
3.) System constructs a Boat object.
4.) System adds Boat to fleet.

Scenario 2: Processing an Expense
1.) User selects 'Expense'.
2.) User enters boat name.
3.) System finds the boat.
4.) User enters expense amount.
5.) System checks spending policy.
6.) System approves or rejects the expense.

Scenario 3: Printing Fleet
1.) User selects 'Print'.
2.) System prints each boat along with totals.
Design Phase:
Domain entities are now mapped to classes with detailed data definitions, constructors, methods, and access rules.

2.1 Class Overview
Classes:
1.) Boat (Serializable)
2.) BoatType (enum inside Boat)
3.) FleetManagement (main controller class)

2.2 Class: Boat
Object Data (per boat):
- type : BoatType (enum)
- name : String
- year : int
- makeModel : String
- length : int
- purchasePrice : double
- expenses : double

Data Access:
- All fields private
- Accessors for name, purchasePrice, expenses
- Mutators included only where logically needed (addExpense)

Constructors:
- Full constructor with all fields
- CSV constructor for loading from text

Methods:
- canSpend(amount): policy check
- addExpense(amount): mutator
- getRemainingBudget(): helper
- toString(): formatted output

2.3 Class: FleetManagement
Object Data:
- fleet : ArrayList<Boat>
- keyboard : Scanner
- DB_FILE : final String

Methods:
- run(): main loop
- getMenuChoice(): input validation
- printFleet(): display output
- addBoat(), removeBoat(), processExpense(): operations
- findBoat(name): helper search
- calculateTotalPurchases(), calculateTotalExpenses(): calculations
- loadFromCSV(), loadFromDB(), saveToDB(): persistence

Final Notes:
This OOAD document follows the instructor's required structure, providing clear mapping from domain analysis → scenarios → class design.
The design supports full functionality, good encapsulation, and clear separation of concerns.
